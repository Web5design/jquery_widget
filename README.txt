TIMEGLIDER jQUERY WIDGET/PLUGIN


We have moved our code repository for the Timeglider JS widget
to our own site: http://timeglider.com/jquery

There are a few reasons for this: Mainly, since we're running
our site in a larger git respository, such that nesting the
smaller widget repo inside of the larger repo was getting too
complicated (and buggy). 

We're still committed to providing the widget to non-commercial
users for free, and to commercial users according to a license,
so come on over!
